# When making commits that are strictly formatting/style changes, add the
# commit hash here, so git blame can ignore the change. See docs for more
# details:
# https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-blameignoreRevsFile
#
# 
# You should be able to execute either
# ./tools/configure-git-blame-ignore-revs.bat or
# ./tools/configure-git-blame-ignore-revs.sh
#
# Example entries:
#
# <full commit hash>  # initial black-format 
# <full commit hash>  # rename something internal
