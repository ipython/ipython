# Start up messages are logged to stdout using the logging module.
# These all happen before the twisted reactor is started and are
# useful for debugging purposes. Can be (10=DEBUG,20=INFO,30=WARN,40=CRITICAL) 
# and smaller is more verbose.

# The engine will try to connect to the controller multiple times, to allow
# the controller time to startup and write its FURL file. These parameters 
# control the number of retries (connect_max_tries) and the initial delay
# (connect_delay) between attemps. The actual delay between attempts gets
# longer each time by a factor of 1.5 (delay[i] = 1.5*delay[i-1])
# those attemps.
# c.Global.connect_delay = 0.1
# c.Global.connect_max_tries = 15

# By default, the engine will look for the controller's JSON file in its own
# cluster directory. Sometimes, the JSON file will be elsewhere and this 
# attribute can be set to the full path of the JSON file.

# Upon starting the engine can be configured to call MPI_Init. This section
# configures that.

# Select which MPI section to execute to setup MPI. The value of this 
# attribute must match the name of another attribute in the MPI config 
# section (mpi4py, pytrilinos, etc.). This can also be set by the --mpi
# command line option.
