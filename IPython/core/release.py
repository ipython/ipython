"""
IPython provides a rich toolkit to help you make the most out of using Python
interactively.  Its main components are:

* Powerful interactive Python shells (terminal- and Qt-based).
* Support for interactive data visualization and use of GUI toolkits.
* Flexible, embeddable interpreters to load into your own projects.
* Tools for high level and interactive parallel computing.

The enhanced interactive Python shells have the following main features:

* Comprehensive object introspection.

* Input history, persistent across sessions.

* Caching of output results during a session with automatically generated
  references.

* Readline based name completion.

* Extensible system of 'magic' commands for controlling the environment and
  performing many tasks related either to IPython or the operating system.

* Configuration system with easy switching between different setups (simpler
  than changing $PYTHONSTARTUP environment variables every time).

* Session logging and reloading.

* Extensible syntax processing for special purpose situations.

* Access to the system shell with user-extensible alias system.

* Easily embeddable in other Python programs and wxPython GUIs.

* Integrated access to the pdb debugger and the Python profiler. 

The parallel computing architecture has the following main features:

* Quickly parallelize Python code from an interactive Python/IPython session.

* A flexible and dynamic process model that be deployed on anything from 
  multicore workstations to supercomputers.

* An architecture that supports many different styles of parallelism, from
  message passing to task farming.

* Both blocking and fully asynchronous interfaces.

* High level APIs that enable many things to be parallelized in a few lines
  of code.

* Share live parallel jobs with other users securely.  

* Dynamically load balanced task farming system.

* Robust error handling in parallel code.

The latest development version is always available from IPython's `GitHub
site <http://github.com/ipython>`_.
