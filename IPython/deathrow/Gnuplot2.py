"""Improved replacement for the Gnuplot.Gnuplot class.

This module imports Gnuplot and replaces some of its functionality with
improved versions. They add better handling of arrays for plotting and more
convenient PostScript generation, plus some fixes for hardcopy().

It also adds a convenient plot2 method for plotting dictionaries and
lists/tuples of arrays.

This module is meant to be used as a drop-in replacement to the original
Gnuplot, so it should be safe to do:

            plotted as data.  If the conversion fails, an exception is
            raised.


        This is a modified version of plot(). Compared to the original in
        Gnuplot.py, this version has several enhancements, listed below.


        Modifications to the input arguments
        ------------------------------------

        (1-d array means Numeric array, list or tuple):

        (i) Any 1-d array which is NOT followed by another 1-d array, is
        automatically zipped with range(len(array_1d)). Typing g.plot(y) will
        plot y against its indices.

        (ii) If two 1-d arrays are contiguous in the argument list, they are
        automatically zipped together. So g.plot(x,y) plots y vs. x, and
        g.plot(x1,y1,x2,y2) plots y1 vs. x1 and y2 vs. x2.

        (iii) Any 1-d array which is followed by None is automatically zipped
        with range(len(array_1d)). In this form, typing g.plot(y1,None,y2)
        will plot both y1 and y2 against their respective indices (and NOT
        versus one another). The None prevents zipping y1 and y2 together, and
        since y2 is unpaired it is automatically zipped to its indices by (i)

        (iv) Any other arguments which don't match these cases are left alone and
        passed to the code below.

        For lists or tuples, the heuristics used to determine whether they are
        in fact 1-d is fairly simplistic: their first element is checked, and
        if it is not a list or tuple itself, it is assumed that the whole
        object is one-dimensional.

        An additional optional keyword 'titles' has been added: it must be a
        list of strings to be used as labels for the individual plots which
        are NOT PlotItem objects (since those objects carry their own labels
        within).


        PostScript generation
        ---------------------

        This version of plot() also handles automatically the production of
        PostScript output. The main options are (given as keyword arguments):

        - filename: a string, typically ending in .eps. If given, the plot is
        sent to this file in PostScript format.

        - hardcopy: this can be set to 0 to override 'filename'. It does not
        need to be given to produce PostScript, its purpose is to allow
        switching PostScript output off globally in scripts without having to
        manually change 'filename' values in multiple calls.

        All other keywords accepted by Gnuplot.hardcopy() are transparently
        passed, and safely ignored if output is sent to the screen instead of
        PostScript.

        For example:

        In [1]: x=frange(0,2*pi,npts=100)

        Generate a plot in file 'sin.eps':

        In [2]: plot(x,sin(x),filename = 'sin.eps')

        Plot to screen instead, without having to change the filename:

        In [3]: plot(x,sin(x),filename = 'sin.eps',hardcopy=0)

        Pass the 'color=0' option to hardcopy for monochrome output:

        In [4]: plot(x,sin(x),filename = 'sin.eps',color=0)

        PostScript generation through plot() is useful mainly for scripting
        uses where you are not interested in interactive plotting. For
        interactive use, the hardcopy() function is typically more convenient:

        In [5]: plot(x,sin(x))

        In [6]: hardcopy('sin.eps')  """

        """Create a hardcopy of the current plot.

        Create a postscript hardcopy of the current plot to the
        default printer (if configured) or to the specified filename.

        Note that gnuplot remembers the postscript suboptions across
        terminal changes.  Therefore if you set, for example, color=1
        for one hardcopy then the next hardcopy will also be color
        unless you explicitly choose color=0.  Alternately you can
        force all of the options to their defaults by setting
        mode='default'.  I consider this to be a bug in gnuplot.

        Keyword arguments:

          'filename=<string>' -- if a filename is specified, save the
              output in that file; otherwise print it immediately
              using the 'default_lpr' configuration option.  If the
              filename ends in '.eps', EPS mode is automatically
              selected (like manually specifying eps=1 or mode='eps').

          'mode=<string>' -- set the postscript submode ('landscape',
              'portrait', 'eps', or 'default').  The default is
              to leave this option unspecified.

          'eps=<bool>' -- shorthand for 'mode="eps"'; asks gnuplot to
              generate encapsulated postscript.

          'enhanced=<bool>' -- if set (the default), then generate
              enhanced postscript, which allows extra features like
              font-switching, superscripts, and subscripts in axis
              labels.  (Some old gnuplot versions do not support
              enhanced postscript; if this is the case set
              gp.GnuplotOpts.prefer_enhanced_postscript=None.)

          'color=<bool>' -- if set, create a plot with color.  Default
              is to leave this option unchanged.

          'solid=<bool>' -- if set, force lines to be solid (i.e., not
              dashed).

          'duplexing=<string>' -- set duplexing option ('defaultplex',
              'simplex', or 'duplex').  Only request double-sided
              printing if your printer can handle it.  Actually this
              option is probably meaningless since hardcopy() can only
              print a single plot at a time.

          'fontname=<string>' -- set the default font to <string>,
              which must be a valid postscript font.  The default is
              to leave this option unspecified.

          'fontsize=<double>' -- set the default font size, in
              postscript points.

          'debug=<bool>' -- print extra debugging information (useful if
              your PostScript files are misteriously not being created).
