""" Integration with gvim, by Erich Heine

Provides a %vim magic command, and reuses the same vim session. Uses
unix domain sockets for communication between vim and IPython. ipy.vim is
available in doc/examples of the IPython distribution.

Slightly touched up email announcement (and description how to use it) by
Erich Heine is here:

Ive recently been playing with ipython, and like it quite a bit. I did
however discover a bit of frustration, namely with editor interaction.
I am a gvim user, and using the command edit on a new file causes
ipython to try and run that file as soon as the text editor opens
up. The -x command of course fixes this, but its still a bit annoying,
switching windows to do a run file, then back to the text
editor. Being a heavy tab user in gvim, another annoyance is not being
able to specify weather a new tab is how I choose to open the file.

Not being one to shirk my open source duties (and seeing this as a
good excuse to poke around ipython internals), Ive created a script
for having gvim and ipython work very nicely together. Ive attached
both to this email (hoping of course that the mailing list allows such
things).

There are 2 files:

ipy_vimserver.py -- this file contains the ipython stuff
ipy.vim -- this file contains the gvim stuff

In combination they allow for a few functionalities:

#1. the vim magic command. This is a fancy wrapper around the edit
magic, that allows for a new option, -t, which opens the text in a new
gvim tab.  Otherwise it works the same as edit -x. (it internally
calls edit -x). This magic command also juggles vim server management,
so when it is called when there is not a gvim running, it creates a
new gvim instance, named after the ipython session name.  Once such a
gvim instance is running, it will be used for subsequent uses of the
vim command.

#2. ipython - gvim interaction. Once a file has been opened with the
vim magic (and a session set up, see below), pressing the F5 key in
vim will cause the calling ipython instance to execute run
filename.py. (if you typo like I do, this is very useful)

#3. ipython server - this is a thread wich listens on a unix domain
socket, and runs commands sent to that socket.

Note, this only works on POSIX systems, that allow for AF_UNIX type
sockets. It has only been tested on linux (a fairly recent debian
testing distro).

To install it put, the ipserver.py in your favorite locaion for
sourcing ipython scripts. I put the ipy.vim in
~/.vim/after/ftplugin/python/.

To use (this can be scripted im sure, but i usually have 2 or 3
ipythons and corresponding gvims open):

import ipy_vimserver
ipy_vimserver.setup('sessionname')

(Editors note - you can probably add these to your ipy_user_conf.py)

Then use ipython as you normally would, until you need to edit
something. Instead of edit, use the vim magic.  Thats it!
