r"""killableprocess - Subprocesses which can be reliably killed

This module is a subclass of the builtin "subprocess" module. It allows
processes that launch subprocesses to be reliably killed on Windows (via the Popen.kill() method.

It also adds a timeout argument to Wait() for a limited period of time before
forcefully killing the process.

Note: On Windows, this module requires Windows 2000 or higher (no support for
Windows 95, 98, or NT 4.0). It also requires ctypes, which is bundled with
Python 2.5+ or available from http://python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/
