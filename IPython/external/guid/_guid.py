###   A globally-unique identifier made up of time and ip and 8 digits for a counter: 
###   each GUID is 40 characters wide
###
###   A globally unique identifier that combines ip, time, and a counter.  Since the 
###   time is listed first, you can sort records by guid.  You can also extract the time 
###   and ip if needed.  
###
###   Since the counter has eight hex characters, you can create up to 
###   0xffffffff (4294967295) GUIDs every millisecond.  If your processor
###   is somehow fast enough to create more than that in a millisecond (looking
###   toward the future, of course), the function will wait until the next
###   millisecond to return.
###     
###   GUIDs make wonderful database keys.  They require no access to the 
###   database (to get the max index number), they are extremely unique, and they sort 
###   automatically by time.   GUIDs prevent key clashes when merging
###   two databases together, combining data, or generating keys in distributed
###   systems.
###
###   There is an Internet Draft for UUIDs, but this module does not implement it.
###   If the draft catches on, perhaps I'll conform the module to it.

# Changelog
# Sometime, 1997     Created the Java version of GUID
#                    Went through many versions in Java
# Sometime, 2002     Created the Python version of GUID, mirroring the Java version
# November 24, 2003  Changed Python version to be more pythonic, took out object and made just a module
# December 2, 2003   Fixed duplicating GUIDs.  Sometimes they duplicate if multiples are created
#                    in the same millisecond (it checks the last 100 GUIDs now and has a larger random part)
# December 9, 2003   Fixed MAX_RANDOM, which was going over sys.maxint
# June 12, 2004      Allowed a custom IP address to be sent in rather than always using the 
#                    local IP address.  
# November 4, 2005   Changed the random part to a counter variable.  Now GUIDs are totally 
#                    unique and more efficient, as long as they are created by only
#                    on runtime on a given machine.  The counter part is after the time
#                    part so it sorts correctly.
# November 8, 2005   The counter variable now starts at a random long now and cycles
#                    around.  This is in case two guids are created on the same
#                    machine at the same millisecond (by different processes).  Even though
#                    it is possible the GUID can be created, this makes it highly unlikely
#                    since the counter will likely be different.
# November 11, 2005  Fixed a bug in the new IP getting algorithm.  Also, use IPv6 range
#                    for IP when we make it up (when it's no accessible)
# November 21, 2005  Added better IP-finding code.  It finds IP address better now.
# January 5, 2006    Fixed a small bug caused in old versions of python (random module use)
