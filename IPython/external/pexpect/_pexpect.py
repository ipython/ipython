"""Pexpect is a Python module for spawning child applications and controlling
them automatically. Pexpect can be used for automating interactive applications
such as ssh, ftp, passwd, telnet, etc. It can be used to a automate setup
scripts for duplicating software package installations on different servers. It
can be used for automated software testing. Pexpect is in the spirit of Don
Libes' Expect, but Pexpect is pure Python. Other Expect-like modules for Python
require TCL and Expect or require C extensions to be compiled. Pexpect does not
use C, Expect, or TCL extensions. It should work on any platform that supports
the standard Python pty module. The Pexpect interface focuses on ease of use so
that simple tasks are easy.

There are two main interfaces to the Pexpect system; these are the function,
run() and the class, spawn. The spawn class is more powerful. The run()
function is simpler than spawn, and is good for quickly calling program. When
you call the run() function it executes a given program and then returns the
output. This is a handy replacement for os.system().

For example::

    pexpect.run('ls -la')

The spawn class is the more powerful interface to the Pexpect system. You can
use this to spawn a child program then interact with it by sending input and
expecting responses (waiting for patterns in the child's output).

For example::

    child = pexpect.spawn('scp foo myname@host.example.com:.')
    child.expect ('Password:')
    child.sendline (mypassword)

This works even for commands that ask for passwords or other input outside of
the normal stdio streams. For example, ssh reads input directly from the TTY
device which bypasses stdin.

    This function runs the given command; waits for it to finish; then
    returns all output as a string. STDERR is included in output. If the full
    path to the command is not given then the path is searched.

    Note that lines are terminated by CR/LF (\\r\\n) combination even on
    UNIX-like systems because this is the standard for pseudo ttys. If you set
    'withexitstatus' to true, then run will return a tuple of (command_output,
    exitstatus). If 'withexitstatus' is false then this returns just
    command_output.

    The run() function can often be used instead of creating a spawn instance.
    For example, the following code uses spawn::

        from pexpect import *
        child = spawn('scp foo myname@host.example.com:.')
        child.expect ('(?i)password')
        child.sendline (mypassword)

    The previous code can be replace with the following::

        from pexpect import *
        run ('scp foo myname@host.example.com:.', events={'(?i)password': mypassword})

    Examples
    ========

    Start the apache daemon on the local machine::

        from pexpect import *
        run ("/usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start")

    Check in a file using SVN::

        from pexpect import *
        run ("svn ci -m 'automatic commit' my_file.py")

    Run a command and capture exit status::

        from pexpect import *
        (command_output, exitstatus) = run ('ls -l /bin', withexitstatus=1)

    Tricky Examples
    ===============

    The following will run SSH and execute 'ls -l' on the remote machine. The
    password 'secret' will be sent if the '(?i)password' pattern is ever seen::

        run ("ssh username@machine.example.com 'ls -l'", events={'(?i)password':'secret\\n'})

    This will start mencoder to rip a video from DVD. This will also display
    progress ticks every 5 seconds as it runs. For example::

        from pexpect import *
        def print_ticks(d):
            print d['event_count'],
        run ("mencoder dvd://1 -o video.avi -oac copy -ovc copy", events={TIMEOUT:print_ticks}, timeout=5)

    The 'events' argument should be a dictionary of patterns and responses.
    Whenever one of the patterns is seen in the command out run() will send the
    associated response string. Note that you should put newlines in your
    string if Enter is necessary. The responses may also contain callback
    functions. Any callback is function that takes a dictionary as an argument.
    The dictionary contains all the locals from the run() function, so you can
    access the child spawn object or any other variable defined in run()
    (event_count, child, and extra_args are the most useful). A callback may
    return True to stop the current run process otherwise run() continues until
    the next event. A callback may also return a string which will be sent to
    the child. 'extra_args' is not used by directly run(). It provides a way to
    pass data to a callback function through run() through the locals
    dictionary passed to a callback."""

        """This is the constructor. The command parameter may be a string that
        includes a command and any arguments to the command. For example::

            child = pexpect.spawn ('/usr/bin/ftp')
            child = pexpect.spawn ('/usr/bin/ssh user@example.com')
            child = pexpect.spawn ('ls -latr /tmp')

        You may also construct it with a list of arguments like so::

            child = pexpect.spawn ('/usr/bin/ftp', [])
            child = pexpect.spawn ('/usr/bin/ssh', ['user@example.com'])
            child = pexpect.spawn ('ls', ['-latr', '/tmp'])

        After this the child application will be created and will be ready to
        talk to. For normal use, see expect() and send() and sendline().

        Remember that Pexpect does NOT interpret shell meta characters such as
        redirect, pipe, or wild cards (>, |, or *). This is a common mistake.
        If you want to run a command and pipe it through another command then
        you must also start a shell. For example::

            child = pexpect.spawn('/bin/bash -c "ls -l | grep LOG > log_list.txt"')
            child.expect(pexpect.EOF)

        The second form of spawn (where you pass a list of arguments) is useful
        in situations where you wish to spawn a command and pass it its own
        argument list. This can make syntax more clear. For example, the
        following is equivalent to the previous example::

            shell_cmd = 'ls -l | grep LOG > log_list.txt'
            child = pexpect.spawn('/bin/bash', ['-c', shell_cmd])
            child.expect(pexpect.EOF)

        The maxread attribute sets the read buffer size. This is maximum number
        of bytes that Pexpect will try to read from a TTY at one time. Setting
        the maxread size to 1 will turn off buffering. Setting the maxread
        value higher may help performance in cases where large amounts of
        output are read back from the child. This feature is useful in
        conjunction with searchwindowsize.

        The searchwindowsize attribute sets the how far back in the incomming
        seach buffer Pexpect will search for pattern matches. Every time
        Pexpect reads some data from the child it will append the data to the
        incomming buffer. The default is to search from the beginning of the
        imcomming buffer each time new data is read from the child. But this is
        very inefficient if you are running a command that generates a large
        amount of data where you want to match The searchwindowsize does not
        effect the size of the incomming data buffer. You will still have
        access to the full buffer after expect() returns.

        The logfile member turns on or off logging. All input and output will
        be copied to the given file object. Set logfile to None to stop
        logging. This is the default. Set logfile to sys.stdout to echo
        everything to standard output. The logfile is flushed after each write.

        Example log input and output to a file::

            child = pexpect.spawn('some_command')
            fout = file('mylog.txt','w')
            child.logfile = fout

        Example log to stdout::

            child = pexpect.spawn('some_command')
            child.logfile = sys.stdout

        The logfile_read and logfile_send members can be used to separately log
        the input from the child and output sent to the child. Sometimes you
        don't want to see everything you write to the child. You only want to
        log what the child sends back. For example::

            child = pexpect.spawn('some_command')
            child.logfile_read = sys.stdout

        To separately log output sent to the child use logfile_send::

            self.logfile_send = fout

        The delaybeforesend helps overcome a weird behavior that many users
        were experiencing. The typical problem was that a user would expect() a
        "Password:" prompt and then immediately call sendline() to send the
        password. The user would then see that their password was echoed back
        to them. Passwords don't normally echo. The problem is caused by the
        fact that most applications print out the "Password" prompt and then
        turn off stdin echo, but if you send your password before the
        application turned off echo, then you get your password echoed.
        Normally this wouldn't be a problem when interacting with a human at a
        real keyboard. If you introduce a slight delay just before writing then
        this seems to clear up the problem. This was such a common problem for
        many users that I decided that the default pexpect behavior should be
        to sleep just before writing to the child application. 1/20th of a
        second (50 ms) seems to be enough to clear up the problem. You can set
        delaybeforesend to 0 to return to the old behavior. Most Linux machines
        don't like this to be below 0.03. I don't know why.

        Note that spawn is clever about finding commands on your path.
        It uses the same logic that "which" uses to find executables.

        If you wish to get the exit status of the child you must call the
        close() method. The exit or signal status of the child will be stored
        in self.exitstatus or self.signalstatus. If the child exited normally
        then exitstatus will store the exit return code and signalstatus will
        be None. If the child was terminated abnormally with a signal then
        signalstatus will store the signal value and exitstatus will be None.
        If you need more detail you can also read the self.status member which
        stores the status returned by os.waitpid. You can interpret this using
        os.WIFEXITED/os.WEXITSTATUS or os.WIFSIGNALED/os.TERMSIG. """

        StringType, EOF, a compiled re, or a list of any of those types.
        Strings will be compiled to re types. This returns the index into the
        pattern list. If the pattern was not a list this returns index 0 on a
        successful match. This may raise exceptions for EOF or TIMEOUT. To
        avoid the EOF or TIMEOUT exceptions add EOF or TIMEOUT to the pattern
        list. That will cause expect to match an EOF or TIMEOUT condition
        instead of raising an exception.

        If you pass a list of patterns and more than one matches, the first match
        in the stream is chosen. If more than one pattern matches at that point,
        the leftmost in the pattern list is chosen. For example::

            # the input is 'foobar'
            index = p.expect (['bar', 'foo', 'foobar'])
            # returns 1 ('foo') even though 'foobar' is a "better" match

        Please note, however, that buffering can affect this behavior, since
        input arrives in unpredictable chunks. For example::

            # the input is 'foobar'
            index = p.expect (['foobar', 'foo'])
            # returns 0 ('foobar') if all input is available at once,
            # but returs 1 ('foo') if parts of the final 'bar' arrive late

        After a match is found the instance attributes 'before', 'after' and
        'match' will be set. You can see all the data read before the match in
        'before'. You can see the data that was matched in 'after'. The
        re.MatchObject used in the re match will be in 'match'. If an error
        occurred then 'before' will be set to all the data read so far and
        'after' and 'match' will be None.

        If timeout is -1 then timeout will be set to the self.timeout value.

        A list entry may be EOF or TIMEOUT instead of a string. This will
        catch these exceptions and return the index of the list entry instead
        of raising the exception. The attribute 'after' will be set to the
        exception type. The attribute 'match' will be None. This allows you to
        write code like this::

                index = p.expect (['good', 'bad', pexpect.EOF, pexpect.TIMEOUT])
                if index == 0:

                elif index == 3:
                    do_something_completely_different()

        instead of code like this::

                try:
                    index = p.expect (['good', 'bad'])
                    if index == 0:
                        do_something()

        These two forms are equivalent. It all depends on what you want. You
