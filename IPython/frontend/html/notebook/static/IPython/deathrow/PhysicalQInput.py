"""Modified input prompt for entering quantities with units.

Modify the behavior of the interactive interpreter to allow direct input of
quantities with units without having to make a function call.

Now the following forms are accepted:

x = 4 m
y = -.45e3 m/s
g = 9.8 m/s**2
a = 2.3 m/s^2   # ^ -> ** automatically

All other input is processed normally.

# This file is an example of how to modify IPython's line-processing behavior
# without touching the internal code. We'll define an alternate pre-processing
# stage which allows a special form of input (which is invalid Python syntax)
# for certain quantities, rewrites a line of proper Python in those cases, and
# then passes it off to IPython's normal processor for further work.

# With this kind of customization, IPython can be adapted for many
# special-purpose scenarios providing alternate input syntaxes.

# This file can be imported like a regular module.

# IPython has a prefilter() function that analyzes each input line. We redefine
# it here to first pre-process certain forms of input

# The prototype of any alternate prefilter must be like this one (the name
# doesn't matter):
# - line is a string containing the user input line.
# - continuation is a parameter which tells us if we are processing a first line of
#   user input or the second or higher of a multi-line statement.
