===========================================
 IPython: Productive Interactive Computing
===========================================

Overview
========

Welcome to IPython.  Our full documentation is available on `our website
<http://ipython.org/documentation.html>`_; if you downloaded a built source
distribution the ``docs/source`` directory contains the plaintext version of
these manuals.  If you have Sphinx installed, you can build them by typing
``cd docs; make html`` for local browsing.


See the `install page <http://ipython.org/install.html>`__ to install IPython.

The Notebook, Qt console and a number of other pieces are now parts of *Jupyter*.
See the `Jupyter installation docs <http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html>`__
if you want to use these.

Officially, IPython requires Python version 2.7, or 3.3 and above.
IPython 1.x is the last IPython version to support Python 2.6 and 3.2.


Instant running
===============

You can run IPython from this directory without even installing it system-wide
by typing at the terminal::

   $ python -m IPython
