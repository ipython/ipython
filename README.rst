===========================================
 IPython: Productive Interactive Computing
===========================================

Overview
========

Welcome to IPython.  Our full documentation is available on `our website
<http://ipython.org/documentation.html>`_; if you downloaded a built source
distribution the ``docs/source`` directory contains the plaintext version of
these manuals.  If you have Sphinx installed, you can build them by typing
``cd docs; make html`` for local browsing.


Dependencies and supported Python versions
==========================================

For full details, see the installation section of the `manual<https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/e51e50d36f2d05061ef7bdcea56531f5fca08f4c/docs/source/install/install.rst>`_;.  The basic parts
of IPython only need the Python standard library, but much of its more advanced
functionality requires extra packages.

Officially, IPython requires Python version 2.7, or 3.3 and above.
IPython 1.x is the last IPython version to support Python 2.6 and 3.2.


Instant running
===============

You can run IPython from this directory without even installing it system-wide
by typing at the terminal::

   $ python -m IPython
