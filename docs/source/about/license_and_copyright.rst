    By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
    to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
    Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
    extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
    granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
    these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
    consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
    Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
    
    
    Section 1 -- Definitions.
    
      a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
         Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
         and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
         arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
         permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
         Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
         Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
         Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
         synched in timed relation with a moving image.
    
      b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
         and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
         accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
    
      c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
         closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
         performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
         Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
         categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
         specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
         Rights.
    
      d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
         absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
         fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
         Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
         agreements.
    
      e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
         any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
         that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
    
      f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
         or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
         License.
    
      g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
         terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
         all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
         Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
    
      h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
         under this Public License.
    
      i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
         process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
         as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
         dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
         available to the public including in ways that members of the
         public may access the material from a place and at a time
         individually chosen by them.
    
      j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
         resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
         the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
         as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
         equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
    
      k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
         under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
    
    
    Section 2 -- Scope.
    
      a. License grant.
    
           1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
              the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
              non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
              exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
    
                a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                   in part; and
    
                b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
    
           2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
              Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
              License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
              its terms and conditions.
    
           3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
              6(a).
    
           4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
              Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
              all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
              and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
              Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
              authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
              necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
              technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
              Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
              simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
              (4) never produces Adapted Material.
    
           5. Downstream recipients.
    
                a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                   recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                   receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                   Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                   Public License.
    
                b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                   any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                   apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                   Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                   Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                   Material.
    
           6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
              may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
              are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
              with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
              the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
              provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
    
      b. Other rights.
    
           1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
              licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
              privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
              the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
              assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
              extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
              Rights, but not otherwise.
    
           2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
              Public License.
    
           3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
              collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
              Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
              under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
              licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
              reserves any right to collect such royalties.
    
    
    Section 3 -- License Conditions.
    
    Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
    following conditions.
    
      a. Attribution.
    
           1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
              form), You must:
    
                a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                   with the Licensed Material:
    
                     i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                        Material and any others designated to receive
                        attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                        the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                        designated);
    
                    ii. a copyright notice;
    
                   iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
    
                    iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                        warranties;
    
                     v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                        extent reasonably practicable;
    
                b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                   retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
    
                c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                   Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                   hyperlink to, this Public License.
    
           2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
              reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
              which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
              reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
              hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
              information.
    
           3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
              information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
              reasonably practicable.
    
           4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
              License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
              Material from complying with this Public License.
    
    
    Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
    
    Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
    apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
    
      a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
         to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
         portion of the contents of the database;
    
      b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
         contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
         Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
         Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
    
      c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
         all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
    
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
    replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
    Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
    
    
    Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
    
      a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
         EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
         AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
         ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
         IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
         WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
         PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
         ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
         KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
         ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    
      b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
         TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
         NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
         INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
         COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
         USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
         ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
         DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
         IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    
      c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
         above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
         possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
         waiver of all liability.
    
    
    Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
    
      a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
         Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
         this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
         terminate automatically.
    
      b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
         Section 6(a), it reinstates:
    
           1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
              it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
              violation; or
    
           2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
    
         For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
         right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
         of this Public License.
    
      c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
         Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
         distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
         will not terminate this Public License.
    
      d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
         License.
    
    
    Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
    
      a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
         terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
    
      b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
         Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
         independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
    
    
    Section 8 -- Interpretation.
    
      a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
         shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
         conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
         be made without permission under this Public License.
    
      b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
         deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
         minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
         cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
         without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
         conditions.
    
      c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
         failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
         Licensor.
    
      d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
         as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
         that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
         processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

Our Copyright Policy
====================

IPython uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to IPython. But, it is important to note that these
contributions are typically only changes (diffs/commits) to the repositories.
Thus, the IPython source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any
single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the
entire IPython Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a
record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they
should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they
commit the change to one of the IPython repositories.

Any new code contributed to IPython must be licensed under the BSD license or
a similar (MIT) open source license.

Miscellaneous
=============

Some files (DPyGetOpt.py, for example) may be licensed under different
conditions. Ultimately each file indicates clearly the conditions under which
its author/authors have decided to publish the code.
