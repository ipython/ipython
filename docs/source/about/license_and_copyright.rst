Our Copyright Policy
====================

IPython uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to IPython. But, it is important to note that these
contributions are typically only changes (diffs/commits) to the repositories.
Thus, the IPython source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any
single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the
entire IPython Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a
record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they
should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they
commit the change to one of the IPython repositories.

Any new code contributed to IPython must be licensed under the BSD license or
a similar (MIT) open source license.

Miscellaneous
=============

Some files (DPyGetOpt.py, for example) may be licensed under different
conditions. Ultimately each file indicates clearly the conditions under which
its author/authors have decided to publish the code.

Versions of IPython up to and including 0.6.3 were released under the GNU
Lesser General Public License (LGPL), available at
