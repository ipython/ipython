Coding conventions
==================

In general, we'll try to follow the standard Python style conventions as
described in Python's `PEP 8`_, the official Python Style Guide.

.. _PEP 8: http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0008.html

Other comments:

- In a large file, top level classes and functions should be separated by 2-3
  lines to make it easier to separate them visually.

- Use 4 spaces for indentation, *never* use hard tabs.

- Keep the ordering of methods the same in classes that have the same methods.
  This is particularly true for classes that implement similar interfaces and
  for interfaces that are similar.

Naming conventions
------------------

In terms of naming conventions, we'll follow the guidelines of PEP 8.  Some of
the existing code doesn't honor this perfectly, but for all new IPython code
(and much existing code is being refactored), we'll use:

- All ``lowercase`` module names.

- ``CamelCase`` for class names.

- ``lowercase_with_underscores`` for methods, functions, variables and
  attributes.

This may be confusing as some of the existing codebase uses a different
convention (``lowerCamelCase`` for methods and attributes).  Slowly, we will
move IPython over to the new convention, providing shadow names for backward
compatibility in public interfaces.

There are, however, some important exceptions to these rules.  In some cases,
IPython code will interface with packages (Twisted, Wx, Qt) that use other
conventions.  At some level this makes it impossible to adhere to our own
standards at all times.  In particular, when subclassing classes that use other
naming conventions, you must follow their naming conventions.  To deal with
cases like this, we propose the following policy:

- If you are subclassing a class that uses different conventions, use its
  naming conventions throughout your subclass.  Thus, if you are creating a
  Twisted Protocol class, used Twisted's
  ``namingSchemeForMethodsAndAttributes.``

- All IPython's official interfaces should use our conventions.  In some cases
  this will mean that you need to provide shadow names (first implement
  ``fooBar`` and then ``foo_bar = fooBar``).  We want to avoid this at all
  costs, but it will probably be necessary at times.  But, please use this
  sparingly!

Implementation-specific *private* methods will use
``_single_underscore_prefix``.  Names with a leading double underscore will
*only* be used in special cases, as they makes subclassing difficult (such
names are not easily seen by child classes).

Occasionally some run-in lowercase names are used, but mostly for very short
names or where we are implementing methods very similar to existing ones in a
base class (like ``runlines()`` where ``runsource()`` and ``runcode()`` had
established precedent).

The old IPython codebase has a big mix of classes and modules prefixed with an
explicit ``IP``. In Python this is mostly unnecessary, redundant and frowned
upon, as namespaces offer cleaner prefixing. The only case where this approach
is justified is for classes which are expected to be imported into external
namespaces and a very generic name (like Shell) is too likely to clash with
something else.  We'll need to revisit this issue as we clean up and refactor
the code, but in general we should remove as many unnecessary ``IP``/``ip``
prefixes as possible. However, if a prefix seems absolutely necessary the more
specific ``IPY`` or ``ipy`` are preferred.

Testing system
==============

It is extremely important that all code contributed to IPython has tests. Tests
should be written as unittests, doctests or as entities that the `Nose`_
testing package will find. Regardless of how the tests are written, we will use
`Nose`_ for discovering and running the tests. `Nose`_ will be required to run
the IPython test suite, but will not be required to simply use IPython.

.. _Nose: http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/

Tests of `Twisted`__ using code should be written by subclassing the
``TestCase`` class that comes with ``twisted.trial.unittest``. When this is
done, `Nose`_ will be able to run the tests and the twisted reactor will be
handled correctly.

.. __: http://www.twistedmatrix.com

Each subpackage in IPython should have its own ``tests`` directory that
contains all of the tests for that subpackage. This allows each subpackage to
be self-contained. If a subpackage has any dependencies beyond the Python
standard library, the tests for that subpackage should be skipped if the
dependencies are not found. This is very important so users don't get tests
failing simply because they don't have dependencies.

We also need to look into use Noses ability to tag tests to allow a more
modular approach of running tests.

.. _devel-config:

Configuration system
====================

IPython uses `.ini`_ files for configuration purposes. This represents a huge
improvement over the configuration system used in IPython. IPython works with
these files using the `ConfigObj`_ package, which IPython includes as
``ipython1/external/configobj.py``.

Currently, we are using raw `ConfigObj`_ objects themselves. Each subpackage of
IPython should contain a ``config`` subdirectory that contains all of the
configuration information for the subpackage. To see how configuration
information is defined (along with defaults) see at the examples in
``ipython1/kernel/config`` and ``ipython1/core/config``. Likewise, to see how
the configuration information is used, see examples in
``ipython1/kernel/scripts/ipengine.py``.

Eventually, we will add a new layer on top of the raw `ConfigObj`_ objects. We
are calling this new layer, ``tconfig``, as it will use a `Traits`_-like
validation model.  We won't actually use `Traits`_, but will implement
something similar in pure Python.  But, even in this new system, we will still
use `ConfigObj`_ and `.ini`_ files underneath the hood. Talk to Fernando if you
are interested in working on this part of IPython. The current prototype of
``tconfig`` is located in the IPython sandbox.
