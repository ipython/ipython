IPython developer's guide
=========================

This are two categories of developer focused documentation:

1. Documentation for developers of *IPython itself*.
2. Documentation for developers of third party tools and libraries
   that use IPython.

This part of our documentation only contains information in the second category.

Developers interested in working on IPython itself should consult
our `developer information <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/Dev:-Index>`_ 
on the IPython GitHub wiki.
