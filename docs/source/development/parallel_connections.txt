Connection Diagrams of The IPython ZMQ Cluster
==============================================

This is a quick summary and illustration of the connections involved in the ZeroMQ based
IPython cluster for parallel computing.

All Connections
===============

The Parallel Computing code is currently under development in Min RK's IPython fork_ on GitHub.

.. _fork: http://github.com/minrk/ipython/tree/newparallel

The IPython cluster consists of a Controller and one or more clients and engines. The goal
of the Controller is to manage and monitor the connections and communications between the
clients and the engines.

It is important for security/practicality reasons that all connections be inbound to the
controller process. The arrows in the figures indicate the direction of the connection.

   All the connections involved in connecting one client to one engine.

The Controller consists of two ZMQ Devices - both MonitoredQueues, one for Tasks (load
balanced, engine agnostic), one for Multiplexing (explicit targets), a Python device for
monitoring (the Heartbeat Monitor).


Registration
------------

   Engines and Clients only need to know where the Registrar ``XREP`` is located to start connecting.

Once a controller is launched, the only information needed for connecting clients and/or
engines to the controller is the IP/port of the ``XREP`` socket called the Registrar. This
socket handles connections from both clients and engines, and replies with the remaining
information necessary to establish the remaining connections.

Heartbeat
---------

   The heartbeat sockets.

The heartbeat process has been described elsewhere. To summarize: the controller publishes
a distinct message periodically via a ``PUB`` socket. Each engine has a ``zmq.FORWARDER``
device with a ``SUB`` socket for input, and ``XREQ`` socket for output. The ``SUB`` socket
is connected to the ``PUB`` socket labeled *HB(ping)*, and the ``XREQ`` is connected to
the ``XREP`` labeled *HB(pong)*. This results in the same message being relayed back to
the Heartbeat Monitor with the addition of the ``XREQ`` prefix. The Heartbeat Monitor
receives all the replies via an ``XREP`` socket, and identifies which hearts are still
beating by the ``zmq.IDENTITY`` prefix of the ``XREQ`` sockets.

Queues
------

    :width: 432px

    :align: center

 Load balanced Task queue on the left, explicitly multiplexed queue on the right.

The controller has two MonitoredQueue devices. These devices are primarily for relaying
messages between clients and engines, but the controller needs to see those messages for
its own purposes. Since no Python code may exist between the two sockets in a queue, all
messages sent through these queues (both directions) are also sent via a ``PUB`` socket to
a monitor, which allows the Controller to monitor queue traffic without interfering with
it.

For tasks, the engine need not be specified. Messages sent to the ``XREP`` socket from the
client side are assigned to an engine via ZMQ's ``XREQ`` round-robin load balancing.
Engine replies are directed to specific clients via the IDENTITY of the client, which is
received as a prefix at the Engine.

For Multiplexing, ``XREP`` is used for both in and output sockets in the device. Clients
must specify the destination by the ``zmq.IDENTITY`` of the ``PAIR`` socket connected to
the downstream end of the device.

At the Kernel level, both of these PAIR sockets are treated in the same way as the ``REP``
socket in the serial version (except using ZMQStreams instead of explicit sockets).
   
Client connections

   Clients connect to an ``XREP`` socket to query the controller
   
The controller listens on an ``XREP`` socket for queries from clients as to queue status,
and control instructions. Clients can connect to this via a PAIR socket or ``XREQ``.

   Engine registration events are published via a ``PUB`` socket.

The controller publishes all registration/unregistration events via a ``PUB`` socket. This
allows clients to stay up to date with what engines are available by subscribing to the
feed with a ``SUB`` socket. Other processes could selectively subscribe to just
registration or unregistration events.
