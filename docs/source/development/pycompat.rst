Writing code for Python 2 and 3
===============================

.. module:: IPython.utils.py3compat
   :synopsis: Python 2 & 3 compatibility helpers


IPython 6 requires Python 3, so our compatibility module
``IPython.utils.py3compat`` is deprecated and will be removed in a future
version. In most cases, we recommend you use the `six module
<https://pythonhosted.org/six/>`__ to support compatible code. This is widely
used by other projects, so it is familiar to many developers and thoroughly
battle-tested.

Our ``py3compat`` module provided some more specific unicode conversions than
those offered by ``six``. If you want to use these, copy them into your own code
from IPython 5.x. Do not rely on importing them from IPython, as the module may
be removed in the future.

     Another compatibility tool, which focuses on writing code for Python 3 and
     making it work on Python 2.
