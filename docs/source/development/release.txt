Release checklist
=================

Most of the release process is automated by the :file:`release` script in the
:file:`tools` directory.  This is just a handy reminder for the release manager.

#. First, run :file:`build_release`, which does all the file checking and
   building that the real release script will do.  This will let you do test
   installations, check that the build procedure runs OK, etc.  You may want to
   disable a few things like multi-version RPM building while testing, because
   otherwise the build takes really long.

#. Run the release script, which makes the tar.gz, eggs and Win32 .exe
   installer.  It posts them to the site and registers the release with PyPI.

#. Updating the website with announcements and links to the updated
   changes.txt in html form. Remember to put a short note both on the news
   page of the site and on Launcphad.

#. Drafting a short release announcement with i) highlights and ii) a link to
   the html changes.txt.

#. Make sure that the released version of the docs is live on the site.

#. Celebrate!
