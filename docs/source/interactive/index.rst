This section of IPython documentation will walk you through most of the IPython
functionality. You do not need to have any deep knowledge of Python to read this
tutorial, though some sections might make slightly more sense if you have already
done some work in the classic Python REPL.

    Some part of this documentation are more than a decade old so might be out
