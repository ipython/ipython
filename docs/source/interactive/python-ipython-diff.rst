Python vs IPython
=================

This document is meant to highlight the main differences between the Python
language and what are the specific construct you can do only in IPython.

Unless expressed otherwise all of the construct you will see here will raise a
``SyntaxError`` if run in a pure Python shell, or if executing in a Python
script. 

Each of these features are describe more in details in further part of the documentation.


Quick overview:
===============


All the following construct are valid IPython syntax:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: ?

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: ?object


.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: object?

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: *pattern*?

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: %shell like --syntax

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: !ls

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: my_files =! ls ~/
    In [1]: for i,file in enumerate(my_file):
       ...:     raw = !echo $file
       ...:     !echo {files[0].upper()} $raw


.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: %%perl magic --function
       ...: @months = ("July", "August", "September");
       ...: print $months[0];
    

Each of these construct is compile by IPython into valid python code and will
do most of the time what you expect it will do. Let see each of these example
in more detail.


Accessing help
==============

As IPython is mostly an interactive shell, the question mark is a simple
shortcut to get help. A question mark alone will bring up the IPython help:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: ?

    IPython -- An enhanced Interactive Python
    =========================================

    IPython offers a combination of convenient shell features, special commands
    and a history mechanism for both input (command history) and output (results
    caching, similar to Mathematica). It is intended to be a fully compatible
    replacement for the standard Python interpreter, while offering vastly
    improved functionality and flexibility.

    At your system command line, type 'ipython -h' to see the command line
    options available. This document only describes interactive features.

    MAIN FEATURES
    -------------
    ...

A single question mark before, or after an object available in current
namespace will show help relative to this object:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [6]: object?
    Docstring: The most base type
    Type:      type


A double question mark will try to pull out more information about the object,
and if possible display the python source code of this object. 

.. code-block:: ipython

    In[1]: import collections
    In[2]: collection.Counter??

    Init signature: collections.Counter(*args, **kwds)
    Source:
    class Counter(dict):
        '''Dict subclass for counting hashable items.  Sometimes called a bag
        or multiset.  Elements are stored as dictionary keys and their counts
        are stored as dictionary values.

        >>> c = Counter('abcdeabcdabcaba')  # count elements from a string

        >>> c.most_common(3)                # three most common elements
        [('a', 5), ('b', 4), ('c', 3)]
        >>> sorted(c)                       # list all unique elements
        ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
        >>> ''.join(sorted(c.elements()))   # list elements with repetitions
        'aaaaabbbbcccdde'
        ...



If you are looking for an object, the use of wildcards ``*`` in conjunction
with question mark will allow you to search current namespace for object with
matching names:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [24]: *int*?
    FloatingPointError
    int
    print


Shell Assignment
================


When doing interactive computing it is common to need to access the underlying shell.
This is doable through the use of the exclamation mark ``!`` (or bang). 

This allow to execute simple command when present in beginning of line:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In[1]: !pwd
    /User/home/

Change directory:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In[1]: !cd /var/etc

Or edit file:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In[1]: !mvim myfile.txt


The line after the bang can call any program installed in the underlying
shell, and support variable expansion in the form of ``$variable`` or ``{variable}``.
The later form of expansion supports arbitrary python expression:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In[1]: file = 'myfile.txt'

    In[2]: !mv $file {file.upper()}


The bang can also be present in the right hand side of an assignment, just
after the equal sign, or separated from it by a white space. In which case the
standard output of the command after the bang ``!`` will be split out into lines
in a list-like object (:see:`IPython Slist`) and assign to the left hand side. 

This allow you for example to put the list of files of the current working directory in a variable:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In[1]: my_files != ls


You can combine the different possibilities in for loops, condition, functions...:

.. code-block:: ipython

    my_files =! ls ~/
    b = "backup file"
    for i,file in enumerate(my_file):
        raw = !echo $backup $file
        !cp $file {file.split('.')[0]+'.bak'}


Magics
------

Magics function are often present in the form of shell-like syntax, but are
under the hood python function. The syntax and assignment possibility are
similar to the one with the bang (``!``) syntax, but with more flexibility and
power. Magic function start with a percent sign (``%``) or double percent (``%%``). 

A magic call with a sign percent will act only one line:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In[1]: %xmode
    Exception reporting mode: Verbose

And support assignment:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In [1]: results = %timeit -r1 -n1 -o list(range(1000))
    1 loops, best of 1: 21.1 µs per loop

    In [2]: results
    Out[2]: <TimeitResult : 1 loops, best of 1: 21.1 µs per loop>

Magic with two percent sign can spread over multiple lines, but do not support assignment:

.. code-block:: ipython

    In[1]: %%bash
    ...  : echo "My shell is:" $SHELL
    ...  : echo "My disk usage is:"
    ...  : df -h
    My shell is: /usr/local/bin/bash
    My disk usage is:
    Filesystem      Size   Used  Avail Capacity  iused   ifree %iused  Mounted on
    /dev/disk1     233Gi  216Gi   16Gi    94% 56788108 4190706   93%   /
    devfs          190Ki  190Ki    0Bi   100%      656       0  100%   /dev
    map -hosts       0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0       0  100%   /net
    map auto_home    0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0       0  100%   /hom
