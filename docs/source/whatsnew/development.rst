.. DO NOT EDIT THIS LINE BEFORE RELEASE. FEATURE INSERTION POINT.

As a reminder, IPython master has diverged from the 7.x branch, thus master may
have more feature and API changes.

Important changes:

 - Fix compatibility with Sphinx 3+ :ghpull:`12235`
 - Remove deprecated matplotlib parameter usage, compatibility with matplotlib
   3.3+ :`122250`

Misc Changes

 - set ``.py`` extension when editing current buffer in vi/emacs. :ghpull:`12167`
 - support for unicode identifiers in ``?``/``??`` :ghpull:`12208`
 - add extra options to the ``Video`` Rich objects :ghpull:`12212`
 - add pretty-printing to SimpleNamespace :ghpull:`12230`

New Deprecation Warnings. 

 - Many object present in ``IPython.core.display`` should  be imported from
   ``IPython.display`` by user and external libraries. Trying to import those
   from ``IPython.core.display`` will trigger a deprecation warning in IPython
   7.14+ and _may_ raise an error in IPython 8+
