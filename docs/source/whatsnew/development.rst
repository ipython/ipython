 Development version
=====================

This document describes in-flight development work.

.. warning::

    Please do not edit this file by hand (doing so will likely cause merge
    conflicts for other Pull Requests). Instead, create a new file in the
    `docs/source/whatsnew/pr` folder


* :class:`~.TextWidget` and :class:`~.TextareaWidget` objects now include a
  ``placeholder`` attribute, for displaying placeholder text before the
  user has typed anything.

* The %load magic can now find the source for objects in the user namespace.
  To enable searching the namespace, use the ``-n`` option.

  .. sourcecode:: ipython

      In [1]: %load -n my_module.some_function

* :class:`~.DirectView` objects have a new :meth:`~.DirectView.use_cloudpickle`
  method, which works like ``view.use_dill()``, but causes the ``cloudpickle``
  module from PiCloud's `cloud`__ library to be used rather than dill or the
  builtin pickle module.

  __ https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cloud

* Added a .ipynb exporter to nbconvert.  It can be used by passing `--to notebook`
  as a commandline argument to nbconvert.

* New nbconvert preprocessor called :class:`~.ClearOutputPreprocessor`. This
  clears the output from IPython notebooks.

* New preprocessor for nbconvert that executes all the code cells in a notebook.
  To run a notebook and save its output in a new notebook::

      ipython nbconvert InputNotebook --ExecutePreprocessor.enabled=True --to notebook --output Executed

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

* :func:`IPython.core.oinspect.getsource` call specification has changed:

  * `oname` keyword argument has been added for property source formatting
  * `is_binary` keyword argument has been dropped, passing ``True`` had
    previously short-circuited the function to return ``None`` unconditionally

* Removed the octavemagic extension: it is now available as ``oct2py.ipython``.

* Creating PDFs with LaTeX no longer uses a post processor.
  Use `nbconvert --to pdf` instead of `nbconvert --to latex --post pdf`.

* Used https://github.com/jdfreder/bootstrap2to3 to migrate the Notebook to Bootstrap 3.

  Additional changes:

  - Set `.tab-content .row` `0px;` left and right margin (bootstrap default is `-15px;`)
  - Removed `height: @btn_mini_height;` from `.list_header>div, .list_item>div` in `tree.less`
  - Set `#header` div `margin-bottom: 0px;`
  - Set `#menus` to `float: left;`
  - Set `#maintoolbar .navbar-text` to `float: none;`
  - Added no-padding convienence class.
  - Set border of #maintoolbar to 0px

* Accessing the `container` DOM object when displaying javascript has been
  deprecated in IPython 2.0 in favor of accessing `element`. Starting with
  IPython 3.0 trying to access `container` will raise an error in browser
  javascript console.

IFrame embedding
````````````````

The IPython Notebook and its APIs by default will only be allowed to be
embedded in an iframe on the same origin.

To override this, set ``headers[X-Frame-Options]`` to one of

* DENY
* SAMEORIGIN
* ALLOW-FROM uri

See `Mozilla's guide to X-Frame-Options <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/X-Frame-Options>`_ for more examples.
