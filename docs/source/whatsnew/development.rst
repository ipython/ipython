 Development version
=====================

This document describes in-flight development work.

- `%%capture` cell magic now captures the rich display output, not just
  stdout/stderr

Select Notebook Name When Renaming a Notebook
---------------------------------------------

The default notebook name is Untitled. It's unlikely you want to keep this name
or part of it when naming your notebook. Instead, IPython will select the text
in the input field so the user can easily type over the name and change it.

clear_output changes
--------------------

* There is no longer a 500ms delay when calling ``clear_output``.
* The ability to clear stderr and stdout individually was removed.
* A new ``wait`` flag that prevents ``clear_output`` from being executed until new
  output is available.  This eliminates animation flickering by allowing the
  user to double buffer the output.
* The output div height is remembered when the ``wait=True`` flag is used.

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

* Python 2.6 and 3.2 are no longer supported: the minimum required
  Python versions are now 2.7 and 3.3.
* The Transformer classes have been renamed to Preprocessor in nbconvert and
  their `call` methods for them have been renamed to `preprocess`.
* The `call` methods of nbconvert post-processsors have been renamed to
  `postprocess`.

* The module ``IPython.core.fakemodule`` has been removed.

* The alias system has been reimplemented to use magic functions. There should be little
  visible difference while automagics are enabled, as they are by default, but parts of the
  :class:`~IPython.core.alias.AliasManager` API have been removed.

* We fixed an issue with switching between matplotlib inline and GUI backends,
  but the fix requires matplotlib 1.1 or newer.  So from now on, we consider
  matplotlib 1.1 to be the minimally supported version for IPython. Older
  versions for the most part will work, but we make no guarantees about it.

* The :command:`pycolor` command has been removed. We recommend the much more capable
  :command:`pygmentize` command from the `Pygments <http://pygments.org/>`_ project.
  If you need to keep the exact output of :command:`pycolor`, you can still use
  ``python -m IPython.utils.PyColorize foo.py``.
