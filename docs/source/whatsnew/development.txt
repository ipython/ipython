Main `ipython` branch
=====================

As of the 0.11 version of IPython, a signifiant portion of the core has been
refactored.  This refactoring is founded on a number of new abstractions.
The main new classes that implement these abstractions are:

* :class:`IPython.utils.traitlets.HasTraitlets`.
* :class:`IPython.core.component.Component`.
* :class:`IPython.core.application.Application`.
* :class:`IPython.config.loader.ConfigLoader`.
* :class:`IPython.config.loader.Config`

We are still in the process of writing developer focused documentation about
these classes, but for now our :ref:`configuration documentation
<config_overview>` contains a high level overview of the concepts that these
classes express.

The changes listed here are a brief summary of the recent work on IPython.
For more details, please consult the actual source.

New features
------------

* The :mod:`IPython.extensions.pretty` extension has been moved out of
  quarantine and fully updated to the new extension API.

* New magics for loading/unloading/reloading extensions have been added:
  ``%load_ext``, ``%unload_ext`` and ``%reload_ext``.

* The configuration system and configuration files are brand new. See the
  configuration system :ref:`documentation <config_index>` for more details.

* The :class:`~IPython.core.iplib.InteractiveShell` class is now a
  :class:`~IPython.core.component.Component` subclass and has traitlets that
  determine the defaults and runtime environment. The ``__init__`` method has
  also been refactored so this class can be instantiated and run without the
  old :mod:`ipmaker` module.

* The methods of :class:`~IPython.core.iplib.InteractiveShell` have
  been organized into sections to make it easier to turn more sections
  of functionality into componenets.

* The embedded shell has been refactored into a truly standalone subclass of
  :class:`InteractiveShell` called :class:`InteractiveShellEmbed`.  All
  embedding logic has been taken out of the base class and put into the 
  embedded subclass.

* I have created methods of :class:`~IPython.core.iplib.InteractiveShell` to
  help it cleanup after itself. The :meth:`cleanup` method controls this. We
  couldn't do this in :meth:`__del__` because we have cycles in our object
  graph that prevent it from being called.

* Created a new module :mod:`IPython.utils.importstring` for resolving
  strings like ``foo.bar.Bar`` to the actual class.

* Completely refactored the :mod:`IPython.core.prefilter` module into
  :class:`~IPython.core.component.Component` subclasses. Added a new layer
  into the prefilter system, called "transformations" that all new prefilter
  logic should use (rather than the older "checker/handler" approach).

* Aliases are now components (:mod:`IPython.core.alias`).

* We are now using an internally shipped version of
  :mod:`~IPython.external.argparse` to parse command line options for
  :command:`ipython`.

* New top level :func:`~IPython.frontend.terminal.embed.embed` function that can be called
  to embed IPython at any place in user's code. One the first call it will
  create an :class:`~IPython.frontend.terminal.embed.InteractiveShellEmbed` instance and
  call it. In later calls, it just calls the previously created
  :class:`~IPython.frontend.terminal.embed.InteractiveShellEmbed`.

* Created a component system (:mod:`IPython.core.component`) that is based on
  :mod:`IPython.utils.traitlets`. Components are arranged into a runtime
  containment tree (not inheritance) that i) automatically propagates
  configuration information and ii) allows components to discover each other
  in a loosely coupled manner. In the future all parts of IPython will be
  subclasses of :class:`~IPython.core.component.Component`. All IPython
  developers should become familiar with the component system.

* Created a new :class:`~IPython.config.loader.Config` for holding
  configuration information. This is a dict like class with a few extras: i)
  it supports attribute style access, ii) it has a merge function that merges
  two :class:`~IPython.config.loader.Config` instances recursively and iii) it
  will automatically create sub-:class:`~IPython.config.loader.Config`
  instances for attributes that start with an uppercase character.

* Created new configuration loaders in :mod:`IPython.config.loader`. These
  loaders provide a unified loading interface for all configuration
  information including command line arguments and configuration files. We
  have two default implementations based on :mod:`argparse` and plain python
  files.  These are used to implement the new configuration system.

* Created a top-level :class:`Application` class in
  :mod:`IPython.core.application` that is designed to encapsulate the starting
  of any IPython process. An application loads and merges all the
  configuration objects, constructs the main application :class:`Component`
  instances and then starts the application running. The default
  :class:`Application` class has built-in logic for handling the IPython
  directory as well as profiles.

* The :class:`Type` and :class:`Instance` traitlets now handle classes given
  as strings, like ``foo.bar.Bar``. This is needed for forward declarations.
  But, this was implemented in a careful way so that string to class
  resolution is done at a single point, when the parent
  :class:`~IPython.utils.traitlets.HasTraitlets` is instantiated.

* :mod:`IPython.utils.ipstruct` has been refactored to be a subclass of 
  dict.  It also now has full docstrings and doctests.
* Created a Trait's like implementation in :mod:`IPython.utils.traitlets`.
  This is a pure Python, lightweight version of a library that is similar to
  :mod:`enthought.traits`.  We are using this for validation, defaults and
  notification in our new component system.  Although it is not API compatible
  with :mod:`enthought.traits`, we plan on moving in this direction so that
  eventually our implementation could be replaced by a (yet to exist) pure
  Python version of :mod:`enthought.traits`.

* Added a new module :mod:`IPython.lib.inputhook` to manage the integration
  with GUI event loops using `PyOS_InputHook`.  See the docstrings in this
  module or the main IPython docs for details.

* For users, GUI event loop integration is now handled through the new
  :command:`%gui` magic command.  Type ``%gui?`` at an IPython prompt for
  documentation.

* The command line options ``-wthread``, ``-qthread`` and
  ``-gthread`` just call the appropriate :mod:`IPython.lib.inputhook`
  functions.

* For developers :mod:`IPython.lib.inputhook` provides a simple interface
  for managing the event loops in their interactive GUI applications.
  Examples can be found in our :file:`docs/examples/lib` directory.

Bug fixes
---------

* Previously, the latex Sphinx docs were in a single chapter.  This has been
  fixed by adding a sixth argument of True to the ``latex_documents``
  attribute of :file:`conf.py`.

* The ``psum`` example in the MPI documentation has been updated to mpi4py
  version 1.1.0.  Thanks to J. Thomas for this fix.

* The top-level, zero-install :file:`ipython.py` script has been updated to 
  the new application launching API.

* Keyboard interrupts now work with GUI support enabled across all platforms
  and all GUI toolkits reliably.

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

* The extension loading functions have been renamed to
  :func:`load_ipython_extension` and :func:`unload_ipython_extension`.

* :class:`~IPython.core.iplib.InteractiveShell` no longer takes an
  ``embedded`` argument. Instead just use the
  :class:`~IPython.core.iplib.InteractiveShellEmbed` class.

* ``__IPYTHON__`` is no longer injected into ``__builtin__``.

* :meth:`Struct.__init__` no longer takes `None` as its first argument.  It
  must be a :class:`dict` or :class:`Struct`.

* :meth:`~IPython.core.iplib.InteractiveShell.ipmagic` has been renamed 
  :meth:`~IPython.core.iplib.InteractiveShell.magic.`

* The functions :func:`ipmagic` and :func:`ipalias` have been removed from
  :mod:`__builtins__`.

* The references to the global :class:`~IPython.core.iplib.InteractiveShell`
  instance (``_ip``, and ``__IP``) have been removed from the user's
  namespace. They are replaced by a new function called :func:`get_ipython`
  that returns the current :class:`~IPython.core.iplib.InteractiveShell`
  instance. This function is injected into the user's namespace and is now the
  main way of accessing IPython's API.

* Old style configuration files :file:`ipythonrc` and :file:`ipy_user_conf.py`
  are no longer supported. Users should migrate there configuration files to
  the new format described :ref:`here <config_overview>` and :ref:`here
  <configuring_ipython>`.

* The old IPython extension API that relied on :func:`ipapi` has been
  completely removed. The new extension API is described :ref:`here
  <configuring_ipython>`.

* Support for ``qt3`` has been dropped.  User's who need this should use
  previous versions of IPython.

* Removed :mod:`shellglobals` as it was obsolete.

* Removed all the threaded shells in :mod:`IPython.core.shell`. These are no
  longer needed because of the new capabilities in
  :mod:`IPython.lib.inputhook`.

* The ``-pylab`` command line flag has been disabled until matplotlib adds
  support for the new :mod:`IPython.lib.inputhook` approach.  The new stuff
  does work with matplotlib, but you have to set everything up by hand.

* New top-level sub-packages have been created: :mod:`IPython.core`, 
  :mod:`IPython.lib`, :mod:`IPython.utils`, :mod:`IPython.deathrow`,
  :mod:`IPython.quarantine`.  All existing top-level modules have been
  moved to appropriate sub-packages.  All internal import statements
  have been updated and tests have been added.  The build system (setup.py
  and friends) have been updated.  See :ref:`this section <module_reorg>` of the
  documentation for descriptions of these new sub-packages.

* Compatability modules have been created for :mod:`IPython.Shell`, 
  :mod:`IPython.ipapi` and :mod:`IPython.iplib` that display warnings
  and then load the actual implementation from :mod:`IPython.core`.

* :mod:`Extensions` has been moved to :mod:`extensions` and all existing
  extensions have been moved to either :mod:`IPython.quarantine` or
  :mod:`IPython.deathrow`. :mod:`IPython.quarantine` contains modules that we
  plan on keeping but that need to be updated. :mod:`IPython.deathrow`
  contains modules that are either dead or that should be maintained as third
  party libraries. More details about this can be found :ref:`here
  <module_reorg>`.

* The IPython GUIs in :mod:`IPython.frontend` and :mod:`IPython.gui` are likely
  broken because of the refactoring in the core.  With proper updates, these
  should still work.  We probably want to get these so they are not using
  :mod:`IPython.kernel.core` (which is being phased out).
