=====================
 Development version
=====================

This document describes in-flight development work.

The CodeMirror js library has been updated fron 2.23 to 2.32 
this might induce a few changes in behavior of keymaps in the notebook, 
especially intenting/deindenting blocks that is now bound to Ctrl+] and ctr+[

* Exception types can now be displayed with a custom traceback, by defining a
  ``_render_traceback_()`` method which returns a list of strings, each
  containing one line of the traceback.

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

* Calling :meth:`InteractiveShell.prefilter` will no longer perform static
  transformations - the processing of escaped commands such as ``%magic`` and
  ``!system``, and stripping input prompts from code blocks. This functionality
  was duplicated in :mod:`IPython.core.inputsplitter`, and the latter version
  was already what IPython relied on. A new API to transform input will be ready
  before release.
