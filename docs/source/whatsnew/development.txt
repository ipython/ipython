 Development version

This document describes in-flight development work.

Redesigned IPython notebook user interface
------------------------------------------

.. add details

Other new features
------------------

* **%install_ext**: A new magic function to install an IPython extension from
  a URL. E.g. ``%install_ext https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/ipython-physics/raw/d1310a2ab15d/physics.py``.

* The :envvar:`IPYTHON_DIR` environment variable, introduced in the Great
  Reorganization of 0.11 and existing only in versions 0.11-0.13, has been
  deprecated. As described in :ghissue:`1167`, the complexity and confusion of
  migrating to this variable is not worth the aesthetic improvement. Please use
  the historical :envvar:`IPYTHONDIR` environment variable instead.

* The default value of *interactivity* passed from
  :meth:`~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell.run_cell` to
  :meth:`~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell.run_ast_nodes`
  is now configurable.
