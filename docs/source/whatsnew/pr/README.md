Documenting What's New
----------------------

When making a new pull request that either adds a new feature, or makes a
backwards-incompatible change to IPython, please add a new `.rst` file in this
directory documenting this change as a part of your Pull Request.

This will allow multiple Pull Requests to do the same without conflicting with
one another. Periodically, IPython developers with commit rights will run a
script and populate [development.rst](../development.rst)
with the contents of this directory, and clean it up.

Files which describe new features can have any name, such as
`antigravity-feature.rst`, whereas backwards incompatible changes **must have**
have a filename starting with `incompat-`, such as
`incompat-switching-to-perl.rst`.  Our "What's new" files always have two
sections,  and this prefix scheme will make sure that the backwards incompatible
changes get routed to their proper section.
