* The :command:`pycolor` command has been removed. We recommend the much more capable
  :command:`pygmentize` command from the `Pygments <http://pygments.org/>`_ project.
  If you need to keep the exact output of :command:`pycolor`, you can still use
  ``python -m IPython.utils.PyColorize foo.py``.
