Notebook diff allows users to do a visual comparison of two notebooks. There are two ways to access this feature.
From the notebook menu, "Diff > Git Compare > [commit_date]" does a comparison of the current notebook with a previous version from git.
From the tree view, selecting two notebooks will show a "Diff" button which will open a comparison between those two notebook files.
